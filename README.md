This project is a frontend-only clone of Udemy's homepage, built using pure HTML and CSS. It replicates the look and layout of the real Udemy platform, including the navigation bar, featured course section, category highlights, and promotional banners â€” all designed without any JavaScript or frameworks.

Features: 1.) Responsive navigation bar with logo and menu links

2.)Hero section with promotional banner and call-to-action button

3.)Featured courses grid with images and titles

4.)Categories section styled similar to Udemy's layout

5.)Clean, responsive, and modern design using only HTML and CSS

Purpose: This project was created to practice structuring a real-world layout and improve my skills in HTML and CSS by cloning a popular platform. It demonstrates my ability to translate complex UI designs into code.
